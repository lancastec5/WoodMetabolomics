R Codes for analysing mass spectra from JEOL AccuTOF.

The analysis codes all assume that you are working from RStudio with Quarto. See https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/hello/rstudio.html for assistance.
All functions are saved and sourced from a directory "R".

Step 1 assumes that file directory is setup that contains a folder for functions "R", a folder for mass spectra to be sourced from "spectra", a folder for binned and thresholded frequency plots "output", and a folder for preprocessing RF models "preds". 

An additional folder "RFmodels" can be used for Step 2.
